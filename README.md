# Music Recommender Model using Cosine Similarity

This project is a music recommender model built using machine learning techniques. It uses cosine similarity algorithms to recommend songs to users based on their listening history and the listening history of similar users.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
https://github.com/Zeecoworld/music-recommender-system

2. Install the necessary libraries:
bash pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To run the recommender model, use the following command:
bash python music-recom.py

## Data Description

The model uses a CSV file containing music data. Each row in the file represents a song and includes features such as BPM (Beats Per Minute), energy, danceability, and popularity.

## Algorithm Explanation

Cosine similarity is a similarity metric that measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. In the context of this model, the vectors represent songs and the features of the songs. The cosine similarity between two songs is a measure of how similar they are.
